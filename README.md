- My main focus right now is learning Cybersecurity and eventually study Cybersecurity in college ~~But thats not happening anytime soon~~

- I use Kali Linux for messing around and testing on my own devices :P
- Im not an expert at cybersecurity, just a beginner trying to learn

- Im mostly not the front face of projects, just a person who is pretty creative with ideas and design.
